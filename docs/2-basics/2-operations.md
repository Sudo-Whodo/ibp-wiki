# Operations

The original documentation for the Infrastructure Builders' Programme indicated that it would extend the mission of Polkadot's and Kusama's [Thousand Validators Programme](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/thousand-validators) to include the provision of core infrastructure services in a decentralized, autonomous, fault-tolerant, and self-sustaining manner.

Operators chosen for the Infrastructure Builders' Programme would lease rack space at unique facilities and deploy owned hardware to provide common endpoint and functionality for a variety of core infrastructure services (RPC endpoints, Snapshots, Bootnodes, Validators, Telemetry, and so on).

More details are available in the documentation below:

- Proposal's [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16USQYVhlyAlrU829EUB2TRoqUC0nnfoS_uCdZ84HT8k).
- Kusama's [Referenda 35](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/35).

## Bounty Management

The programme was initially funded by a bounty of the Kusama treasury, it will be maintained in the future with funding from both Polkadot and Kusama bounties.

The bounties are managed by their relevant curators via a 3/5 multi-sig account.

Each curator provides a secured account that is used to create the 3/5 multi-sig.

Payments to members are executed by child-bounties.
