# Membership

The Infrastructure Builders' Programme is open for applications.

The only universal prerequisite is to provide validator services under the ***Thousand Validators' Programme*** both in [Kusama](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/thousand-validators/) and [Polkadot](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/thousand-validators):

1. Launch validation services in Kusama and obtain a rank of 25 :heavy_check_mark:
2. Launch validation services in Polkadot and obtain a rank of 25 :heavy_check_mark:
3. Apply to the Infrastructure Builders' Programme! :rocket:

Depending on the expertise and commitment capacity of the interested candidates, they can choose between the **Professional** or **Hobbyist** paths with incremental  rewards for each milestone in their path, as a way to allow varying levels of participation in the programme. It gives both less available individuals a chance to do more while allowing more dedicated members to take on a professional role.
