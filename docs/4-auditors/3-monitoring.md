# Monitoring

The members agree to the following SLA.

The [SLA Monitor](https://github.com/dotsama-ibp/dotsama-ibp/tree/main/monitor) will test for these conditions periodically. Failure to meet the SLA would result in loss of 'points', which could affect the member payments and/or membership.

Each one of the members of the Programme should run a node of the monitoring network, here are their deployments
