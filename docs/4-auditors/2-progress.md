### Requirements for Milestone P3

For this milestone, there is some preliminary work to be done by the members in charge of GeoDNS and Anycast services for IBP, as for example, to launch the services and register these in the polkadotjs app repository:

| Service    | Endpoint            | Administrator | Polkadot                                              | Kusama                                                | Westend                                               |

The rest of the members of the Infrastructure Builders' Programme must report their services to the monitoring system so the endpoint administrators add their locations to the applicable geographic territories, members can only be added when they are providing services (at least 1 backend server) in each and every of these networks:
